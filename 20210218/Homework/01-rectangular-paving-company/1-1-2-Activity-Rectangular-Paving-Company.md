## Rectangular Paving Company

## Introduction

The purpose of this program is to calculate the total cost to pave a driveway.

In the first version of the program, you will ask the user to input the width and length of the driveway. You will calculate the total area and perimeter of the driveway, then calculate the cost of paving based on the fixed cost of various materials.

In the second version of the program, you will ask the user to input the cost of materials as well.

This activity is designed to help you practice thinking through how to run calculations in Java based on user input.

## Instructions

1. Locate the `RectPavingCompany` project found in the `starter-code` directory.

2. Complete the code so that the program meets all of the requirements provided. 

3. The requirements must be implemented in the order provided.

4. Notice that there are two versions of the requirements.

5. All code must be contained within the `main()` method of the `RectPavingCompany` class.

6. Once your code has been written, test it using `RectPavingCompanyTest`.

## Version 1: Requirements

* It must prompt the user for the width of the driveway as an integer (in feet).

* It must prompt the user for the length of the driveway as an integer (in feet).

* It must calculate and display the area of the driveway.

* It must calculate and display the perimeter of the driveway.

* Based on the area and perimeter, it must calculate the total cost of the driveway, using the following fixed costs:

   - The cost of the cement for the driveway is $12.50/square foot. Cement is used for the area of the driveway.

   - The cost of the framing/footers for the driveway is $8.25/linear foot. Framing is used for the perimeter of the driveway.

   - The program must calculate and display the subtotal cost of the cement.

   - The program must calculate and display the subtotal cost of the framing/footers.

## Version 2: Requirements

Add modifications to the program. Modifications should be added to the code created in Version 1. Do not create a new project for Version 2.

Modify the program so that it does the following:

* Prompts the user for the cost of cement.

* Prompts the user for the cost of the framing/footers.

* Calculates and displays the subtotal cost of the cement and framing/footers as in the previous version.
