## Katas for Lesson 2

## Introduction

In these katas, you will practice performing mathematical Java calculations.

## Requirements for all Katas

- Add the code necessary to the `main()` method of each class found in the starter-code project `U1M1L2Katas`.

- The requirements for each class are listed in the relevant section.

- Each class has an associated test that you can run to confirm that the class functions as intended.

- Once you have completed each of the classes, you can test them all at once using `AllKatasTest`.

### Kata 1: AverageThree

1. In the `AverageThree` class, find the average of three numbers inputted by the user.

2. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 2: MultiplyThree

1. In the `MultiplyThree` class, multiply three numbers inputted by the user.

2. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 3: AddFive

1. In the `AddFive` class, add five numbers inputted by the user.

2. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 4: SubtractTwo

1. In the `SubtractTwo` class, subtract the second number from the first number inputted by the user.

2. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 5: AddThirteen 

1. In the `AddThirteen` class, add 13 to the value inputted by the user, and print the result to the screen.

2. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 6: AddFiveAndDouble

1. In the `AddFiveAndDouble` class, add five to the number inputted by the user and then double it.

2. Print the result to the screen.

3. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.

### Kata 7: DoubleAndAddFive

1. In the `DoubleAndAddFive` class, double the number inputted by the user and then add five.

2. Print the result to the screen.

3. Run the associated test to ensure that your work is correct.
