## CommandLineGram

## Introduction

In this activity, you are writing code for a social media service&mdash;we'll call it CommandLineGram, in honor of a certain popular photo-sharing service.

When new users visit CommandLineGram, they must register for the site by entering specific information about themselves.

You will create the code that will prompt users to enter particular information, collect and store the information, and display the information to the user in a readable format. Countless web services that require user input use this type of code.

## Requirements

The program must collect the following information from users:

- First name

- Last name

- Email

- Twitter handle

- Age

- Country

- Profession

- Favorite operating system

- Favorite programming language

- Favorite computer scientist

- Favorite keyboard shortcut

- Have you ever built your own computer?

- If you could be any superhero, who would it be?

## Instructions

1. Download and open the starter code zip file.

2. Open the `CommandLineGram` project.

3. Locate the `main()` method of the `CommandLine` class.

4. Within the `main()` method, write code that prompts the user to input the information listed in the preceding Requirements section, in the provided order.

5. Then write code that displays the information to the user after all the information has been collected. The information should be formatted to be readable.

6. Finally, test your code using the `CommandLineTest()` function.

#### Hint/Reminder

User input is collected using the `Scanner` class. For more information, see the [W3Schools page on Scanner](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp).
