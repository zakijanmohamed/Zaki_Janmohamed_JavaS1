# 1.2.1 Katas

## Introduction

In these katas, you will practice creating UML diagrams for a variety of objects. Remember Grady Booch's definition of an object: "An object has state, behavior, and identity."

## Requirements for All Katas

1. Use [draw.io](http://draw.io/) to create UML diagrams for each of the following objects.

2. You’ll want to consider what properties and methods you might want these objects to have.

3. When you have completed your diagrams, save them as either a PNG or JPEG file and add them to your `YYYYMMDD` folder for tonight's homework.

4. Finally, upload them to Github.

**Hint:** For more guidance, refer to the [draw.io documentation on uml class diagrams](https://drawio-app.com/uml-class-diagrams-in-draw-io/).
