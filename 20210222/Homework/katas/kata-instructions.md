## Katas for Lesson 4

## Introduction

In this lesson, we learned why we use methods and how they can be used to better organize code.

In these katas, we will be creating a variety of methods. Read the requirements and follow the instructions to successfully complete these katas.


## Requirements for all Katas

- Add the code necessary to the `App` class found in the project `U1M1L4Katas`.

- The instructions for each method are listed in the relevant sections.

- Tests can be found in `AppTest`. Once you have written each method, uncomment the associated test and run `AppTest`.

## Kata 1: Subtract

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to subtract two integers.

1. Locate `subtract` in the starter code.

2. Create a method called `subtract()` that takes two `int` parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns the value of `b` subtracted from `a`.

## Kata 2: Subtract or Zero

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to subtract two integers and return a specific result depending on the answer.

1. Locate `subtractOrZero` in the starter code.

2. Create a method called `subtractOrZero()` that takes two `int` parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns the value of `b` subtracted from `a`, unless the result is less than zero, in which case, return `0`.

## Kata 3: Max

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to enter three numbers and return the largest one.

1. Locate `max` in the starter code.

2. Create a method called `max()` that takes three `int` parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and returns the value of the largest of the three.

## Kata 4: Min

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to enter three numbers and return the smallest.

1. Locate `min` in the starter code.

2. Create a method called `min()` that takes three `int` parameters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and returns the value of the smallest of the three.

## Kata 5: Is Larger

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to enter two numbers and respond based on the order of the numbers.

1. Locate `isLarger` in the starter code.

2. Create a method called `isLarger()` that takes two `int` parameters (first and second) and returns `true` if the first is greater than second.
