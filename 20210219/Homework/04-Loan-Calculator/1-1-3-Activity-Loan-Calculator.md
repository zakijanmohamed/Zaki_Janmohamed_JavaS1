## Loan Calculator

## Introduction

In this activity, you will practice creating programs that perform calculations. This activity is an example of calculation in a real-world situation. Read the requirements and follow the instructions to successfully complete this activity.


## Requirements

- Complete the following requirements in the `LoanCalculator` project found in the `starter-code` directory.

- All code must be contained within the `main()` method of the `LoanCalculator` class.

- The requirements must be implemented in the order provided.

- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `LoanCalculatorTest`.

## Instructions

Write a Java program that calculates and displays a mortgage payment amount given the following information:

- The amount of the mortgage

- The term of the mortgage

- The annual interest rate of the mortgage

For the formula to calculate the payment, use the first formula on the [Mortgage Professor page on mortgage formulas](https://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm).

#### Hints

- Remember to divide the annual interest rate by 100. For example, if the annual interest rate is 12%, you must use 0.12 in your calculation.

- The monthly interest rate is equal to the annual interest rate divided by 12.
