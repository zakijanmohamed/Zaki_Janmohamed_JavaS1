## Hi-Lo

## Introduction

You’ve been learning about Java’s random number generator and practicing how to create programs. In the activity Hi-Lo, you will use this knowledge to build a number-guessing game program. Read the requirements and follow the instructions to successfully complete this activity.

## Requirements

- All code must be contained within the `main()` method of the `HiLo` class.

- The instructions must be implemented in the order provided.

- The program must display a message that says, `“OK, [name of user], here are the rules:"`

- Once your code has been written, it can be tested using `HiLoTest`.

## Instructions

Code the game to follow these rules:

1. Have the program display a message that says, `“Welcome to Hi-Lo!”`

2. Make the program prompt the user to input his or her name.

3. Display a message that says, `“OK, [name of user], here are the rules:”`

4. Elicit the computer to generate a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

5. Prompt the user to guess the number.

6. If the user guesses the number correctly, display the following messages:

   - `“Congratulations, [name of user]! You win!”`

   - `"It took you [number of guesses] guesses to find my number!"`

7. If the user does not guess the number correctly, display the following:

   - `“Too low!”` if the guess is too low.

   - `“Too high!”` if the guess is too high.

8. If the guess is too low or too high, have the program prompt the user for another guess. This should continue until the number is guessed correctly.
