## Katas for Lesson 3

## Introduction

In these katas, we will be building small-block programs to practice getting user input in different situations. Read the requirements and follow the instructions to successfully complete these katas.

## Requirements for all Katas

- Add the code necessary to the `main()` method of each class found in the project `U1M1L3Katas`.

- The requirements for each class are listed in the relevant section.

- Each class has an associated test that you can run to test that your class functions as intended.

- Once you have completed each of the classes, you can test them all at once using `AllKatasTest`.

## Kata 1: Range Checker

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to guess a number within a certain range.

1. Locate `RangeChecker` in the starter code

2. Write a program that asks the user for a number between 15 and 32 (inclusive).

3. The program must continue to prompt the user until they provide a number that is in range.

4. Then, once they do, output the number to the console.

## Kata 2: Count To

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to count from 0 to a number of their choice.

1. Locate `CountTo` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that prompts a user to input a number and prints a count from 0 to that input.

## Kata 3: Count By Two

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to start from 0 and count by 2 to a number of their choice.

1. Locate `CountByTwo` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that prompts a user to input a number and prints a count from 0 to that input, but counts by 2.

## Kata 4: Count by Thirteen

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to start from 0 and count by 13 to a number of their choice.

1. Locate `CountByThirteen` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that prompts a user to input a number and prints a count from 0 to that input, but counts by 13.

## Kata 5: Even or Odd

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to enter a number, and the program will state whether it’s even or odd.

1. Locate `Even or Odd` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that gets user input (an integer) and prints whether it's EVEN or ODD.

## Kata 6: Is Java Keyword

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt a user to enter a word, and the program will state whether or not it’s a Java keyword.

1. Locate `IsJavaKeyword` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that gets user input (a string) and print out whether or not it is a Java keyword.

> **Hint:** You will need to locate a list of Java keywords to complete this kata.

## Kata 7: Your Age Can

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt the user to enter their age and then determine whether that person fits into the categories provided.

1. Locate `YourAgeCan` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that asks the user's age and then prints whether or not that person fits the following categories:

   - Can vote (18+).

   - Can drink alcohol (21+).

   - Can be president (35+).

   - Is eligible for AARP (55+).

   - Can retire (65+).

   - Is an octogenarian (80-89).

   - Is more than a century old (100+).

## Kata 8: Ultimate Question

### Instructions

In this kata, you will prompt the user to enter a number until they guess the correct one.

1. Locate `UltimateQuestion` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that continues to ask for input between 1 and 100 until the user enters 42.

3. Once they do, print `"That's the number I was looking for! 42 is definitely the answer!"`

## Kata 9: Favorite Programming Language

### Instructions

In this kata, you will ask the user for their favorite programming language until they guess the correct answer.

1. Locate `FavoriteProgrammingLanguage` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that continues to ask for the user's favorite programming language until they type in "Java".

3. Once they do, print `"That's what I was looking for! Java is definitely the answer!"`

## Kata 10: Age Again

### Instructions

In this kata, you will ask a user for their age and ask a follow-up question based on his or her answer.

1. Locate `AgeAgain` in the starter code.

2. Write a program that asks for the user's age and then asks a follow-up question based on the value:

   - Less than 14: Ask what grade they're in and then print `"Wow! [user answer] grade - that sounds exciting!"`

   - Between 14 and 18 (inclusive): Ask if they're planning to go to college. If the answer is "yes" (all lowercase), ask what college and then print `"[user answer] is a great school!"`. If the answer is "no" (all lowercase), ask what they want to do after high school, then print `"Wow, [user answer] sounds like a plan!"`

   - Greater than 18: Ask what their job is, then print `"[user answer] sounds like a great job!"`
