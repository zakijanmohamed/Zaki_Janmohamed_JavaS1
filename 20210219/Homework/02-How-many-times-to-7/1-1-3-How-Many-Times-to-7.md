## How Many Times to 7?

## Introduction

You learned about Java’s facility to generate random numbers to simulate tasks like rolling dice or creating input from a simulated user in a game. This activity reinforces the use of Java’s random number generator by having you roll virtual dice. Read the requirements and follow the instructions to successfully complete this activity.

## Requirements

The responses to the questions provided must be displayed in your code.

> **Note:** There is no starter code for this activity.

## Instructions

- The program will roll a pair of virtual dice (use the random number generator) 100 times and keep track of the following information:

  - How many rolls it took to roll the first 7.

  - The total number of times that 7 was rolled, out of the 100 rolls.

- This information must be displayed to the user after it has been calculated.

## Bonus

- Prompt the user to pick the number of times they want to roll the dice (any number from 1&ndash;100).

- Keep track of and display this information for all the numbers that can be rolled on the dice (2&ndash;12).
