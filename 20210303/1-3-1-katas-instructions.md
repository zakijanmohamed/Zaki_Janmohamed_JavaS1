# Katas 1.3.1

## Introduction

In this kata, you will write and implement tests for a variety of methods that relate to physics.

## Requirements

- All classes should be part of the `com.company` package.

- Tests should be written in the `test/java` directory.

- You will need to create an implementation class named `Physics`.

- All numbers need to be created as the data type “double.”

## Instructions

1. Create a new project called `U1M3L1Katas`.

2. Write tests for, and then implement, the following methods:

     - `calculateForce` which returns the product of `mass` and `acceleration`.
     
     - `calculateVelocity` which returns `distance2` minus `distance1` divided by `time2` minus `time1`.
     
     - `calculateMass` which returns `weight` divided by `gravity`.
     
     - `calculateAcceleration` which returns `velocity2` minus `velocity1` divided by `time2` minus `time1`.
     
     - `calculateDistance` which returns `velocity` times `time`.

**Hint:** Remember to cover all relevant facets of testing that we've talked about: appropriate test naming, equivalence classes, JUnit annotations (Before, Test, etc.), as well as anything else that may fit.
