# 1.2.5 Katas

## Katas

## Requirements

- Add the code necessary to the `starter-code` project `U1M2L5Katas`.

- All classes should part of the `com.company` package.

- All classes should have a `no-args` (or the `default`) constructor.

- You can test your classes by uncommenting the associated code in `AllKatasTest` and running it.

## Instructions

1. Create the following classes, each of which should implement the provided `Shape` interface:

   - `Square`

   - `Circle`
   
   - `Triangle`

2. Create a new interface called `Clock` that has the following methods:

   - `void displayTime()`, which takes in no arguments.

   - `void timer()`, which takes in an integer `hour` and integer `minute`.

3. Create a class called `AnalogClock` that implements the `Clock` interface.

4. Create a new interface called `Alarm` that has the following method:

   - `void sound()`, which takes in no arguments.

5. Create a class called `Buzzer` that implements the `Alarm` interface.

6. Create a class called `DigitalClock`. This class is both a clock and an alarm, so implement both the `Clock` and `Alarm` interfaces.
