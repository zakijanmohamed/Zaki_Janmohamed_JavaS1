# 1.2.2 Katas

## Katas

## Introduction

In these katas, you will build a class that adheres to the specifications of the UML diagrams found in the starter code.

## Requirements for all Katas

- All code should be added to the `starter-code` project `U1M2L2Katas`.

- All classes should be a part of the `com.company` package.

- Tests can be found in the `test/java` directory.

- Once you have written each class, uncomment the code in the associated test and run it.

- Once all classes have been written, you can test them at once by uncommenting the code in `AllKatasTest` and running it.

## Kata 1

### Instructions

1. Working off of the UML diagrams found in `starter-code`, create a class for each of the objects that have been modeled. Do not worry about using these classes in any way&mdash;just build the class to the specifications in the UML diagrams.

2. The constructor for each class should initialize every property of the object, like in the following example:

    ```java
    public Lion(String nameIn, int ageIn, int weightIn) {
        this.name = nameIn;
        this.age = ageIn;
        this.weight = weightIn;
    }
    ```

3. Every class should be properly encapsulated&mdash;that is, properties should only be accessible via getters and setters.
